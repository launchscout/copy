#Ryan Arthur
##Designer

Ryan feels like every project at Gaslight has its own path, but the research phase is always one of the most important pieces for him. It’s when he tries to see things from the client and user perspectives and wrap his mind around the problem that needs to be solved. This initial discovery phase turns into ideas for a visual foundation and user experience. Then Ryan starts building it all in HTML and CSS.

A native of Cincinnati, Ryan studied digital design at the University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning (DAAP). Originally, he was drawn to animation, but a semester long co-op at BLT, a movie poster company in Los Angeles, sparked his love for web design. Ryan built a site for one of the firm’s charity partners and took a lot of pride in the final product. He also did design co-ops at RushCard, a pre-paid credit card company, and Kinetic Vision, a product development services company.

Ryan’s final co-op was at Gaslight, and he liked it so much that he came back for a second co-op then joined the company full-time after graduation. He fell in love with the environment, people and learning something new every day. Right now he aspires to add JavaScript to his skill set.

When he’s not at work, Ryan lives in Hyde Park and spends his free time catching up with friends near and far.

###Surprising Fact
It’s a small world: Ryan’s grandfather served as an Indian Hill police officer with Gaslight co-founder Bill Barnett’s dad.
