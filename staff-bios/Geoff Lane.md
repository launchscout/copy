#Geoff Lane##DeveloperGeoff runs a tech blog called [Zorched.net](http://www.zorched.net/), and as far as we can tell, he [zorches](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zorch?s=t) through life, too. He’s lived in six different states and never stayed in one spot longer than six years. If you flipped through his current and former passports, you’d find stamps from 15 different countries, including South Africa, Costa Rica and India. He’s also worked in a long list of programming languages: Java, C# (.net), Ruby, Groovy, Clojure, Haskell, Scala and others.At Gaslight, Geoff works with clients to help them solve problems with technology, often using Ruby and JavaScript. He’s focused on finding concise solutions and creating code that’s easily readable and maintainable, so it can successfully grow and change over time. As part of this process, he might refactor the same code five or six times to arrive at a better solution.Geoff studied philosophy at Ohio University and found that the logic rules he picked up in class gave him an advantage when he started working in C++. His career spans a range of companies, including programming gigs at start-ups, an agency and consulting shops. Most recently Geoff worked as a developer at Neo, where he contributed to software projects for AT&T, ICANN and others.He lives in Oakley with his wife and two cats, Oliver and Phoebe. Geoff loves Swedish metal bands, cooking and running.###Surprising FactHe was once on a plane with the actor who played Screech on Saved by the Bell, and only recognized him after hearing the familiar Screech voice.###Connect With Geoff[Twitter](https://twitter.com/geofflane)<br>[Github](https://github.com/geofflane)<br>Email geoff@teamgaslight.com[SHORT]<br>Geoff Lane is a developer at Gaslight, a Cincinnati software development firm that transforms businesses with web-based technology.
