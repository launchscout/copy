#Chris Moore##Managing PartnerChris has big plans for Gaslight: He wants to make it the best place in the world to build software within the next five years. As the managing partner, he sets the vision for the company then makes sure the financial resources are in place to make it happen. He’s also focused on leadership and building strong teams.A long-time developer, Chris loves programming because it gives him the superpowers to solve tough business problems. Locally, he’s committed to growing and strengthening the tech community. Chris is the co-founder of QCMerge, a web and tech conference, and the monthly [QCMerge Drinkup](http://www.meetup.com/QCMDrinkup/). He’s also the founder of the [Cincinnati JavaScript User Group](http://blog.cincijs.com/) and the [Embernati User Group](http://www.meetup.com/EmberNati/). Chris grew up in Southeastern Indiana, and after high school, he worked a variety of odd jobs after deciding college wasn’t a good fit. He circled back to his childhood love for computers while working at UPS, switching from forklift driving to a third shift job on the IT team. He rebuilt an Access database and gradually built a tool that tracked the picking and shipping process.He went on to work as a database manager for Adidas and eventually moved to South Carolina to work as a project manager on footwear. He also built a Web app that added customization to the order planning process. In 2010, he moved to greater Cincinnati to pursue freelance development work and that’s where he met the other Gaslight partners.Today he lives in Ludlow, Kentucky, with his wife, three kids and a dog named Sasha. They enjoy camping as a family.###Surprising FactHe has a crazy good memory. We dare you: Ask him to recite his junior high girlfriend Megan’s phone number.###Connect With Chris[Twitter](https://twitter.com/cdmwebs)<br>[Github](https://github.com/cdmwebs)<br>Email chrism@teamgaslight.com[SHORT]Chris Moore is Managing Partner at Gaslight, a Cincinnati software development firm that transforms businesses with web-based technology.
