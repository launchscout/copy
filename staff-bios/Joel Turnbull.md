#Joel Turnbull##DeveloperIf you’re lucky, you’ll stop by Gaslight on a day when Joel is singing and playing the guitar. It’s something he does while trying to solve development problems. At Gaslight, he’s a full-stack developer who builds Web apps in Ruby and JavaScript, but he’s also known for his ability to resolve conflict and talk to just about anyone.Before starting his professional career, Joel studied business with a concentration in information systems at Indiana University. He went on to hold several Web design and development jobs, but something drew him to the more analytic problem-solving side of things. Eventually, he moved into doing development full-time, and most recently worked at a local company called Online Rewards.Joel met the Gaslight team through the Cincinnati Agile Roundtable and knew he wanted to join the company. It was a chance to work with a team of developers and continue to improve his Ruby skills. Joel helped start the [Gaslight blog](http://teamgaslight.com/blog/) and plays a key role in managing it. He also spoke at RailsConf 2014 in Chicago.When he’s not at work, Joel splits his time between Over the Rhine and Hamilton. You might find him running, playing fantasy and strategy games, or hanging out with his three kids.###Surprising FactHe’s a former member of both a White Stripes tribute band and a Black Sabbath tribute band.###Connect With Joel[Twitter](https://twitter.com/joelturnbull)<br>[Github](https://github.com/joelturnbull)<br>Email joel@teamgaslight.com[SHORT]<br>Joel Turnbull is a Developer at Gaslight, a Cincinnati software development firm that transforms businesses with web-based technology.
