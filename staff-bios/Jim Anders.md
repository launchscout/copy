#Jim Anders##DeveloperJim fell in love with programming way back in the fourth grade. He remembers working with BASIC on an Apple IIe at school and learning some very simple functions and variables. It was enough to hook him on development for life, and he’s taught himself everything from Flash and ActionScript to Ruby in his spare time.After eight years in the Army, Jim worked at help desk jobs, but his employers soon discovered his development skills and tapped those talents, too. Most recently he worked at Top Gun Sales Performance, traveling around the country to set up and configure software for police departments and train the staff how to use it. At night, he’d head back to his hotel room and write code for himself.Eventually, he moved into a developer role at Top Gun, and after hanging out at countless [Gaslight Coffee Fridays,](http://teamgaslight.com/coffee) he joined our team. Jim works on a range of client projects and taught our first ever 12-week class in Ruby on Rails. When he’s not coding, you might find him working out, reading or hanging out on his family’s farm near Washington Court House, Ohio.###Surprising FactTough on the outside but soft on the inside: Jim cried at How to Train Your Dragon 2.###Connect With Jim[Twitter](https://twitter.com/janders223)<br>[Github](https://github.com/janders223)<br>Email jim@teamgaslight.com[SHORT]<br>Jim Anders is a Developer at Gaslight, a Cincinnati-based software development firm that transforms businesses with technology.
