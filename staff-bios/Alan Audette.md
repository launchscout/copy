#Alan Audette##DeveloperAlan describes building software systems as easy. The hard part? Understanding the client’s business well enough to know what actually needs to be built. He enjoys working on collaborative teams to clearly define problems and build the right solutions, often with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.As a kid, Alan was fascinated with computers. Unlike mechanical engines, he couldn’t actually see how they worked, so he started teaching himself programming at age 12. By high school, he was teaching half his AP computer science class C because the teacher was only one chapter ahead in the textbook.Alan went on to major in information systems at the University of Cincinnati, but the course material covered quite a few things he’d already learned on his own, so he switched to finance. After graduating, he spent his early career primarily working for consulting companies and doing on-site development work for large Fortune 500 companies.In addition to working at Gaslight, Alan is the Co-founder of [Springzy](http://www.springzy.co), a reward and recognition platform for restaurant employees. He lives in Delhi with his wife and three kids.###Surprising FactHe got his first car at age 10. It was a 1946 rust brown Ford with no engine that he hoped to fix up.###Connect With Alan[Twitter](https://twitter.com/alanaudette)<br>[Github](https://github.com/aaudette)<br>Email alan@teamgaslight.com[SHORT BIO]Alan Audette is a Developer at Gaslight, a Cincinnati software development firm that transforms businesses with web-based technology.
