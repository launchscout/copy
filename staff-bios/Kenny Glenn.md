#Kenny Glenn##DesignerKenny’s first full-time professional job was at an agency in Dayton, Ohio, and his new employer asked him a career-shaping question: Do you want to do print or Web? He chose Web and placed himself on a path that led to Gaslight.He loves that technology is always changing and that he never stops learning. Today Kenny enjoys working on user-focused design and front-end development—digging in on everything from discovery to styles. He’s always focused on keeping software fun and easy to use.Before formally entering the tech world, Kenny studied interactive multimedia for two years at a vocational school. Then he earned an associate's degree in graphic design from the School of Advertising Art in Kettering, Ohio. From there he went on to work at two different marketing agencies and a Cincinnati start-up called Repp, which is an online identity verification service.Kenny lives in Bellevue, Kentucky, with his wife and their cat, Pixel. When he’s not hanging out with them, he loves playing amateur disc golf and adding to his snazzy shoe and sneaker collection.###Surprising FactKenny taught half the Gaslight office how to make fart noises with their hands.###Connect With Kenny[Twitter](https://twitter.com/_kennyglenn)<br>[Github](https://github.com/kennyglenn)<br>Email kenny@teamgaslight.com[SHORT]<br>Kenny Glenn is a Designer at Gaslight, a Cincinnati-based software development firm that transforms businesses with technology.
