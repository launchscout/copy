#Alex Padgett##DeveloperAlex grew up just outside Cincinnati and spent a lot of time as a kid tinkering around with the family computer, often breaking Windows 95. He was also an avid video gamer and played several games semi-competitively during high school, including Quake 3, Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.When it was time for college, Alex put his technology interests aside and followed in his dad’s footsteps by enrolling in a pre-pharmacy program at the University of Cincinnati. Two years later he switched his major over to computer science and discovered that he loved the theory behind it. Eventually, he landed a co-op at a company called American Technology and Services, where he wrote a program to simulate the maintenance cost of jet engines over different time periods.Alex went on to work at Topic Design in Cincinnati, where he did Web design and development. Next he moved to a tech start-up, and after meeting most of the Gaslight team at the [QCMerge Drinkup,](http://www.meetup.com/QCMDrinkup/) a meetup for Web and tech types, he joined our company to do a mix of frontend and backend development. He focuses on creating solutions for clients and writing clear and approachable code.When’s not at Gaslight, Alex lives in Hyde Park. He’s into video games, craft beer, playing guitar and riding his motorcycle.###Surprising FactAlex didn’t try macaroni and cheese until he was 22, but now it’s one of his favorite foods.###Connect With Alex[Twitter](https://twitter.com/apcomplete)<br>[Github](https://github.com/apcomplete)<br>Email alexp@teamgaslight.com[SHORT]<br>Alex Padgett is a Developer at Gaslight, a Cincinnati software development firm that transforms businesses with web-based technology.
