#Tammy Gambrel##DesignerTammy has loved art since she was a young girl. Her mom worked at an art museum in Oxford, Ohio, when she was growing up, and  Tammy thought the museum was one of the most enchanting places on Earth.Today she brings her artistic eye and illustration talents to her work as a front-end designer and developer at Gaslight. She’s also the creator of Wendell, the charming and slightly klutzy 404 robot on the Gaslight website.Tammy studied art history and painting at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and went on to work at many of Cincinnati’s major arts organizations. She started out in finance at the Cincinnati Art Museum and later became the Director of Development and Donor Relations at the Contemporary Arts Center and the Director of Special Events for the Cincinnati Ballet.She also founded a local art gallery with her sister, and her paintings have appeared in numerous shows. When she’s not at work, you might find Tammy at home in Finneytown with her two dachshunds, Astrid and Obadiah. She’s obsessed with tattoos and hot yoga.###Surprising FactShe once sold two paintings to Courtney Love on Etsy.###Connect With Tammy[Twitter](https://twitter.com/SilversunTammy)<br>[Github](https://github.com/tammygambrel)<br>Email tammy@teamgaslight.com[SHORT]<br>Tammy Gambrel is a Designer at Gaslight, a Cincinnati software development firm that transforms businesses with web-based technology.
