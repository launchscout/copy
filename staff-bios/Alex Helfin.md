#Alex Helfin##Developer Co-opAlex is a student at the University of Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning (DAAP). Her major is graphic communications design with a focus on digital design and interaction. She came to Gaslight as a co-op, and after her semester-long stint was over, Alex stayed on as a part-time developer and made plans to spend her second co-op here, too.When she was younger, Alex customized her MySpace page, but she didn’t realize she was actually playing around with computer code until she went to college. Originally, she wanted to be a graphic designer but quickly found herself drawn to the structure and analytical nature of programming.Her goal for any project: Make it better than her last, learning while producing good projects. You might find Alex working in HTML, CSS or JavaScript. She also dabbles in Backbone, AngularJS and Rails, even serving as a teaching assistant in one of our Ruby on Rails training classes.If she’s not at work or school, you might find Alex at home in Cleves, out at a live music show or reading comic books. The Sandman is her all-time favorite.###Surprising FactAlex and a friend once hung out with the lead singer of the Misfits after a show. The conversation revolved around NFL football.###Connect With Alex[Twitter](https://twitter.com/heflinao)<br>[Github](https://github.com/heflinao)<br>Email alex@teamgaslight.com[SHORT]<br>Alex Helfin is a Developer Co-op at Gaslight, a Cincinnati software development firm that transforms businesses with web-based technology.
