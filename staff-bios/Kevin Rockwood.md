#Kevin Rockwood##DeveloperKevin grew up on a hobby farm in Wisconsin with chickens, peacocks, rabbits, sheep and a llama named Ben. When he wasn’t outside, he’d often tinker with mechanical projects. He rigged the door to his childhood bedroom with a motor, chain and motion detector, so it automatically opened when someone walked by it.Despite these early technology experiments, Kevin didn’t discover programming until college. He attended the University of Wisconsin at River Falls where he earned a degree in music with a minor in computer science. From there, he spent two summers as a recording engineer for the Aspen Music Festival. Then he moved to Cincinnati and took a Web design and development job at Vine Street Interactive. At Gaslight Kevin writes Web apps in Ruby and JavaScript, and he’s always focused on creating clear and concise code. In fact, he describes himself as a bit of a perfectionist. Kevin shares his love for technology through teaching. He helped lead a Ruby on Rails class at Northern Kentucky University, as well as workshops about Ember.js and AngularJS in California.As our resident audio expert, Kevin built the studio where we record the [Gaslight podcast](http://teamgaslight.com/blog/?tagged=podcast) and live streams user groups. He also records live musical performances through his company [Rockwood Productions](http://rockwoodpro.com/).When he’s not working, you might find Kevin longboarding around Oakley, where he lives with his wife and their golden retriever.###Surprising FactAt age 13, Kevin souped up a discarded riding lawn mower to make it go 40 miles per hour. Then he crashed it.###Connect With Kevin[Twitter](https://twitter.com/kevinrockwood)<br>[Github](https://github.com/rockwood)<br>Email kevin@teamgaslight.com[SHORT]<br>Kevin Rockwood is a Developer at Gaslight, a Cincinnati software development firm that transforms businesses with web-based technology.
